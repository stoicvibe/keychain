KeyChain is a password management application for the Danger Hiptop and T-Mobile Sidekick created by Micah N. Gorrell. The application uses Blowfish encryption to securely store your password information to the Danger backend. The original source was pulled from skdr.net before it became unavailable. This project aims to keep the code alive and available for other developers.
